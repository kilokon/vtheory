# Concepts and Terminology { .smaller }
(All VFX involve CGI today, but not all CGI is part of a VFX process.)

## Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI)  {.smaller transition="fade" transition-speed="fast"}
::: {.incremental}
- Technology roots trace back to the 1960s.
- Term "CGI" was coined to distinguish computer-created visual content from traditional hand-drawn animation and practical effects.
- CGI encompasses various techniques including 3D modeling, digital compositing, motion capture, etc.
- The term has evolved to include both photorealistic and stylized digital content across transmedia platforms.

## Visual Effects (VFX) {.smaller transition="fade" transition-speed="fast"}
::: {.incremental}
- 1890s-1920s: "Trick Photography" or "Photographic Effects"
- 1930s-1960s: "Special Effects" (covering both practical and optical effects)
- 1970s-1980s: "Optical Effects" for post-production work
- 1990s: "Visual Effects" (VFX) becomes standard industry terminology
- 2000s: Sub-categories emerge (Digital VFX, Practical VFX, Hybrid VFX)
- 2010s: "Digital Effects," "Post-VFX," and "Virtual Production" terminology
:::

## Modern VFX Categories {.smaller }

- Compositing: Combining multiple image elements
- Matte Painting: Creating digital backgrounds and environments
- Motion Capture: Recording actor movements for digital characters
- Simulation: Physics-based effects (water, fire, destruction)
- Digital Doubles: CGI replicas of actors
- Virtual Production: Real-time VFX during filming

## CGI Vs VFX { .smaller }
- CGI is the digital content creation aspect.
- VFX is the composite process that integrates CGI with real-world footage and effects.


## Artificial Intelligence {.smaller}

- Rotoscoping (e.g., AI roto in Nuke, After Effects)
- Asset creation (e.g., AI-generated textures, models)
- Animation (e.g., markerless motion capture)
- Compositing (e.g., segmentation, relighting, upscaling)
- Shot planning (e.g., generative storyboards, previs)

## Pipeline Architecture {.smaller }
A pipeline architecture in VFX defines the structured flow of data, assets, and tasks across departments using tools, scripts, and file conventions.
Pipelines are relevant to project management, especially in domains like VFX, animation, game development, and software engineering.

::: {.incremental}
- Modular: each department functions as a module
- Version-controlled: assets and scenes track revisions
- Automated: scripts and tools handle repetitive tasks
- Cross-software: Maya, Houdini, Nuke, etc., integrated
- Scalable: from indie studios to multi-site facilities
:::

## Digital Production Pipelines {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}
- Linear [Tasks follow a strict sequence (Waterfall model)].
- Non-linear or General [Tasks run in parallel or with iterative loops].

# Asset Types and Terminology {.smaller}
:::{.fragment .fade-in}
An asset in VFX refers to any reusable production element—characters, props, environments, vehicles, etc.
:::

:::{.incremental}
- Models
- Textures
- Lookdev (Renders)
- Rigs
- Animations (Anim Cache)
- Plates
- Scan Data

| Category          | Description                                      | Examples                     |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Hero Assets**   | High-detail, focus objects requiring meticulous modeling/texturing. | Main characters, key props. |
| **Background Assets** | Environment fillers, optimized for performance. | Crowds, foliage, distant buildings. |
| **FX Assets**     | Dynamic elements like fire, smoke, or particle systems. | Explosions, weather effects. |


:::{.fragment .fade-in}

| Asset Type       | Key Characteristics                          | Common Examples         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Static Assets** | No deformation; optimized for texture resolution and LOD | Buildings, furniture    |
| **Dynamic Assets** | Require rigging, skinning, and animation-friendly topology | Characters, vehicles, cloth |

Production Note: 
"Static object modeling prioritizes photogrammetric accuracy and modular reuse, reducing asset generation time in large-scale environments."

# Asset Lifecycle {.smaller}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
![](imgs/concepttoprod.png){width=69%}
:::

## General Cycle of a 3D asset {.smaller}

```
Concept → Modeling → Texturing → Rigging → LookDev → Approval → Publishing → Integration → Final Render
                         ↑                 ↓
                    Versioning ← QA/Feedback ← Revisions
```

## Art Directing Assets
Art directing an asset is the process of shaping its design, form, style, and visual qualities through feedback and decision-making by an art director, ensuring it fits the visual language and narrative tone of the production.

## Caching {.smaller}
Caching is saving a snapshot of the work.


## Versioning
Asset production is iterative, with changes tracked and managed systematically.


## Publishing
Publihing is the act of finalizing and distributing an asset for downstream use. 

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
An artist/department in the pipeline publishes a version of the asset. The the feedback cycle might 
give a retake on the asset or approve it.
:::

:::{.incremental}
- Artist Fidelity
- Performance Optimization
- Asset approval leads, supervisors, directors.
:::

## Feedback Cycle {.smaller} 

![](./imgs/asset_feedback_cycle.png){fig-align="center"}

Approval Conditions: \

- ✅ Approved → Asset is published
- 🔁 Retake → Feedback is passed down the chain for revision
- 📌 Conditional Approval → Used but flagged for future fixes
