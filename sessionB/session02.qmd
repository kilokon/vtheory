# Stage 1: Image Acquisition

## Photograph
Capture high-quality, overlapping images of an object or scene from multiple angles, ensuring good lighting and coverage.


## Image VS Video


# Stage 2: Image Cleaning
Preprocess images by correcting exposure, removing noise, or masking unwanted areas to improve quality for processing.


# Stage 3: Point Cloud Generation
Use software to process images and generate a 3D point cloud algorithms.

:::

# Stage 4: Mesh Building
Convert the point cloud into a 3D mesh by triangulating points, creating a surface model.

# Stage 5: Texture Space
Project and map image data onto the mesh to create a UV texture map, ensuring proper alignment and detail.

# Stage 6: Clean Up
Refine the mesh by removing artifacts, filling holes, smoothing surfaces, or reducing polygon count for optimization.

# Stage 7: Export
